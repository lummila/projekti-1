# Instructions
# Welcome to Chase the rat! You'll need to enter an existing username and a PIN-code to play with your user
# OR if you are a new player you can create your own username and a four-digit PIN-code.
# In this game you'll travel between different airports, trying to find 'the rat' who owes you money.
# The rat has done some airport-hopping and he has travelled somewhere in Europe.
# The game will give you clues of the rat's route and his final location.
# Each game will draw a new route of five airports, the fifth being the current location of the rat, before he leaves Europe and is beyound your reach.
# Your goal is to follow the given clues to try to find him. There are a total of ten rounds in each game for you to try to find the rat.
# You'll need to unravel the clues and follow the route that the rat took.
# You have a limited amount of money to spend on your trip and your emissions will alter your final score in the game.
# The game will start by telling you your first clue and after unravelling it you can start travelling to the first airport.
# If you get the given clue correct, and travel to the right airport, the game will give you a clue to reach the next airport.
# If you travel to the wrong airport you'll miss one round.
# With the clues, you also have chance to be given a coincidence. The coincidences can either have a positive OR negative impact on you.
# But remember: if you solve the clue the possibility to get a positive coincidence is much higher
# AND if you travel to the wrong airport you are more likely to be drawn a negative coincidence.
# Each time you travel you'll use one round and if you travel to a wrong location, you'll have to wait one extra round.
# If you reach the final destination where the rat is within the given rounds: You'll win.
# After reaching the goal the game will calculate your final points by summing up
# how many rounds you used, your emissions and the money that's left.
# If you don't find The rat within the ten rounds: you'll lose.
